[EXECUTIVE SUMMARY]

 U2020 OSS system manages and provides basic functions, such as configuration
 management, performance management, fault management, security management, 
 log management, topology management, software management, and system 
 management for various Huawei mobile network elements (NEs). It also provides 
 a variety of optional functions. During an engagement we found an application
 -level denial of service on a network daemon used by the system. An attacker 
 can cause the crash of the target network service effectively denying access 
 to legitimate users.
 
[VULNERABLE VERSIONS]

 The following version of the products were affected by the
 vulnerabilities; previous versions may be vulnerable as well:
  - U2020 Taishan fullstack (OSS Rel SW MAEV100R020C10SPC230)
 
[TECHNICAL DETAILS]

 The network daemon listening on port TCP/8007 is vulnerable to an application
 Denial-of-Service due to a huge memory allocation while being fuzzed (dumb 
 fuzz). During a fuzzing session it was discovered that the aforementioned 
 deamon allocates a huge number of resources and it's killed by the system 
 scheduler (it was observed that after 1 to 2 minutes of fuzzing the deamon 
 starts using all the CPUs at 100%).A n attacker with network visibility of the
 affected U2020 service can cause the crash of the target network service 
 effectively denying access to legitimate users (application-level DoS).

 It is possible to reproduce the vulnerability following these steps:
  1. Install radamsa and nmap (required for the ncat dependency)
  2. Run the following command on a Linux box: while true; do echo 'LST
     FMARSTDIR:FUNCTYPE=FaultDiagnosis;' | radamsa | ncat <ip> --ssl; done
  3. Notice that the deamon crashes after 1 to 2 minutes
